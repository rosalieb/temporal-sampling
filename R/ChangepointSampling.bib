  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2014 British Ecological Society. Predictive models relating ecological assemblages to environmental conditions are widely used in environmental impact assessment and biomonitoring. Such models are often parameterized using comprehensive ecological sampling and taxonomic identification efforts. Limited resources mean that expensive sampling and analytical procedures should be planned to maximize information gain and minimize unnecessary expense. However, there has been little consideration of cost-effectiveness in parameterizing predictive models using ecological assemblages and no explicit consideration of cost-effectiveness in balancing investment in the crucial aspects of sample size and taxonomic resolution. Using lacustrine diatom (Bacillariophyceae) assemblages from four large-scale (c. 77 000-1{$\cdot$}3 million km2) data sets containing between 207 and 493 lakes, we address the following questions: (1) how does taxonomic resolution affect information content; (2) how does sample size affect information content for different taxonomic resolutions; and (3) what are the most cost-effective strategies for constructing environmental assessment models using diatom assemblages across a range of budgets? We use weighted averaging regression models for pH, phosphorus, salinity and lake depth and realistic data collection costs to examine the relationship between cost and model information content (R2and root mean squared error of prediction). For diatom-based models, finer taxonomic resolutions almost always provide more cost-effective information content than collecting more samples, with (morpho)species being the most appropriate taxonomic resolution for nearly all budget scenarios. Information content exhibits an asymptotic relationship with sample size and budget, with greatest information gain during initial sample size increases, and little gain beyond c. 100 samples. Smaller sample sizes can also achieve surprising predictive power in some cases, suggesting low-cost regional models may be achievable. However, caution is necessary in such an approach, because spatial dependencies in predictions may be missed and analogues with predicted assemblages may be poor. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate the utility of explicitly considering cost estimates to determine optimal sampling effort and taxonomic resolution for ecological assemblage models. For large, regional biomonitoring programmes, cost-effective sampling could save millions of dollars. Our framework for determining optimal trade-offs in ecological assemblage models is easily adaptable to other taxa and analytical techniques used in biomonitoring and environmental assessment.

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2018 The Authors. Journal of Applied Ecology \textcopyright{} 2018 British Ecological Society The question of when to monitor and when to act is fundamental to applied ecology and notoriously difficult to answer. Value of information (VOI) theory holds great promise to help answer this question for many management problems. However, VOI theory in applied ecology has only been demonstrated in single-decision problems and has lacked explicit links between monitoring and management costs. Here, we present an extension of VOI theory for solving multi-unit decisions of whether to monitor before managing, while explicitly accounting for monitoring costs. Our formulation helps to choose the optimal monitoring/management strategy among groups of management units (e.g. species, habitat patches) and can be used to examine the benefits of partial and repeat monitoring. To demonstrate our approach, we use case-simulated studies of single-species protection that must choose among potential habitat areas, and classification and management of multiple species threatened with extinction. We provide spreadsheets and code to illustrate the calculations and facilitate application. Our case studies demonstrate the utility of predicting the number of units with a given outcome for problems with probabilities of discrete states and the efficiency of having a flexible approach to manage according to monitoring outcomes. Synthesis and applications. The decision to act or gather more information can have serious consequences for management. No decision, including the decision to monitor, is risk-free. Our multi-unit expansion of Value of Information theory can reduce the risk in monitoring/acting decisions for many applied ecology problems. While our approach cannot account for the potential value of discovering previously unknown threats or ecological processes via monitoring programmes, it can provide quantitative guidance on whether to monitor before acting, and which monitoring/management actions are most likely to meet management objectives.},

  abstract = {For an ecological monitoring program to be successful over the long-term, the perceived benefits of the information must justify the cost. Financial limitations will always restrict the scope of a monitoring program, hence the program's focus must be carefully prioritized. Clearly identifying the costs and benefits of a program will assist in this prioritization process, but this is easier said than done. Frequently, the true costs of monitoring are not recognized and are, therefore, underestimated. Benefits are rarely evaluated, because they are difficult to quantify. The intent of this review is to assist the designers and managers of long-term ecological monitoring programs by providing a general framework for building and operating a cost-effective program. Previous considerations of monitoring costs have focused on sampling design optimization. We present cost considerations of monitoring in a broader context. We explore monitoring costs, including both budgetary costs, what dollars are spent on, and economic costs, which include opportunity costs. Often, the largest portion of a monitoring program budget is spent on data collection, and other, critical aspects of the program, such as scientific oversight, training, data management, quality assurance, and reporting, are neglected. Recognizing and budgeting for all program costs is therefore a key factor in a program's longevity. The close relationship between statistical issues and cost is discussed, highlighting the importance of sampling design, replication and power, and comparing the costs of alternative designs through pilot studies and simulation modeling. A monitoring program development process that includes explicit checkpoints for considering costs is presented. The first checkpoint occurs during the setting of objectives and during sampling design optimization. The last checkpoint occurs once the basic shape of the program is known, and the costs and benefits, or alternatively the cost-effectiveness, of each program element can be evaluated. Moving into the implementation phase without careful evaluation of costs and benefits is risky because if costs are later found to exceed benefits, the program will fail. The costs of development, which can be quite high, will have been largely wasted. Realistic expectations of costs and benefits will help ensure that monitoring programs survive the early, turbulent stages of development and the challenges posed by fluctuating budgets during implementation. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Nonlinear relationships can contain breakpoints where there is an unexpected change in an ecological response to an environmental driver, which may result in ecological regime shifts. We investigated the occurrence of nonlinearity and breakpoints in relationships between total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), and total dissolved carbon (DOC) concentrations and ecological responses in streams with varying land uses. We calculated breakpoints using piecewise regression, two dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov (2DKS), and significant zero crossings (SiZer) methods. We found nonlinearity was common, occurring in half of all analyses, with some evidence of multiple breakpoints. Linearity, by contrast, occurred in less than 14\% of cases, on average. Breakpoints were related to land use gradients, with 34\textendash{}43\% agricultural cover associated with DOC and TDN breakpoints, and 15\% wetland and 9.5\% urban land associated with DOC and nutrient breakpoints, respectively. While these breakpoints are likely specific to our study area, our study contributes to the growing literature of the prevalence and location of ecological breakpoints in streams, providing watershed managers potential criteria for catchment land use thresholds.},

In the case of ecological communities under stress, the risk of approaching a tipping point is unknown, but its stakes are high. Here, we test recently developed critical slowing-down indicators as early-warning signals for detecting the proximity to a potential tipping point in structurally complex ecological communities. We use the structure of 79 empirical mutualistic networks to simulate a scenario of gradual environmental change that leads to an abrupt first extinction event followed by a sequence of species losses until the point of complete community collapse. We find that critical slowing-down indicators derived from time series of biomasses measured at the species and community level signal the proximity to the onset of community collapse. In particular, we identify specialist species as likely the best-indicator species for monitoring the proximity of a community to collapse. In addition, trends in slowing-down indicators are strongly correlated to the timing of species extinctions. This correlation offers a promising way for mapping species resilience and ranking species risk to extinction in a given community. Our findings pave the road for combining theory on tipping points with patterns of network structure that might prove useful for the management of a broad class of ecological networks under global environmental change.},

  abstract = {Global environmental change presents a clear need for improved leading indicators of critical transitions, especially those that can be generated from compositional data and that work in empirical cases. Ecological theory of community dynamics under environmental forcing predicts an early replacement of slowly replicating and weakly competitive ``canary'' species by slowly replicating but strongly competitive ``keystone'' species. Further forcing leads to the eventual collapse of the keystone species as they are replaced by weakly competitive but fast-\-replicating ``weedy'' species in a critical transition to a significantly different state. We identify a diagnostic signal of these changes in the coefficients of a correlation between compositional disorder and biodiversity. Compositional disorder measures unpredictability in the composition of a community, while biodiversity measures the amount of species in the community. In a stochastic simulation, sequential correlations over time switch from positive to negative as keystones prevail over canaries, and back to positive with domination of weedy species. The model finds support in empirical tests on multi-d\- ecadal time series of fossil diatom and chironomid communities from lakes in China. The characteristic switch from positive to negative correlation coefficients occurs for both communities up to three decades preceding a critical transition to a sustained alternate state. This signal is robust to unequal time increments that beset the identification of early-w\- arning signals from other metrics.},

  abstract = {In 1990, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and state agencies initiated an 8-year experimental sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) control program on Lake Champlain to reduce parasitic phase sea lamprey and increase sport fish survival and growth. Twenty-four 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) treatments were conducted on 13 tributary systems, and nine Bayluscide treatments were conducted on five deltas. Most tributaries received two rounds of treatment, 4 years apart. Trap catches of spawning-phase sea lamprey in three monitored tributaries declined by 80\textendash{}90\% from 1989 to 1997, but nest counts were reduced by only 57\% during the same period. Sixteen of 24 TFM treatments reduced ammocoetes to less than 10\% of pre-treatment levels. Eight of nine Bayluscide treatments resulted in mean ammocoete mortality rates over 85\% in caged test animals. Nontarget effects were noted among amphibians, mollusks, macroinvertebrates, native lamprey, and other fishes, and were higher for Bayluscide treatments than TFM. Recovery of delta taxa occurred within 4 years after treatment. Wounding rates on lake trout and Atlantic salmon were reduced in the Main Lake basin. Catches-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and estimated angler catch of lake trout increased. A moderate (25\%), statistically significant increase in survival of 3\textendash{}4 yr lake trout was noted. Returns of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) to tributaries increased significantly after treatment, and there was an estimated 3-fold increase in returns to the Main Lake sport fishery. Angler catches of brown (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were higher in 1997 than in 1990. Economic analysis of the program indicated a 3.5:1 economic benefit: cost ratio. Results indicate that the experimental control program was successful, and provide justification for continuing sea lamprey control on Lake Champlain.},

Inherent technical constraints often limit the possibility to obtain from sediment both regular and high-resolution time series rather most palaeoecological time series obtained from sediment records represent time-aggregated ecological signals. In this study, the robustness of EWS detection to temporal aggregation was addressed using simulated time series mimicking ecological dynamics. Using a stochastic differential equation based on a deterministic model exhibiting a critical transition between two stable equilibria, two different scenarios were simulated using different combinations of forcing and noise intensities (critical slowing-down and driver-mediated flickering scenarios). The temporal resolution of each simulated time series was progressively decreased by averaging the data from t = 1 up to t = 10 time-unit intervals. EWSs [standard deviation, autocorrelation at lag-1 (AR(1)), skewness and kurtosis] were applied to all time series. Robustness of EWSs to data aggregation was assessed through a block-based approach using Kendall rank correlation Tau. Standard deviation appeared to be robust to data aggregation up to t = 10 for the slowing-down scenario and up to t = 5 for the driver-mediated flickering scenario while autocorrelation remained robust up to t = 2 for the slowing-down scenario and did not support data aggregation for the driver-mediated scenario. Skewness and kurtosis performed poorly for the two scenarios and were not considered as robust EWSs even for the original simulated time series using the block-based approach. Our results suggest that high-resolution palaeoecological time series could be in a large extent suitable to support EWS analyses.},

Although RPA are widely touted as a cost-effective way to collect high-quality wildlife population data, the validity of these claims is unclear. Using life-sized, replica seabird colonies containing a known number of fake birds, we assessed the accuracy of RPA-facilitated wildlife population monitoring compared to the traditional ground-based counting method. The task for both approaches was to count the number of fake birds in each of 10 replica seabird colonies. We show that RPA-derived data are, on average, between 43\% and 96\% more accurate than the traditional ground-based data collection method. We also demonstrate that counts from this remotely sensed imagery can be semi-automated with a high degree of accuracy. The increased accuracy and increased precision of RPA-derived wildlife monitoring data provides greater statistical power to detect fine-scale population fluctuations allowing for more informed and proactive ecological management.},

  abstract = {Monitoring of threatened species and threatened ecosystems is critical for determining population trends, identifying urgency of management responses, and assessing the efficacy of management interventions. Yet many threatened species and threatened ecosystems are not monitored and for those that are, the quality of the monitoring is often poor. Here we provide a checklist of factors that need to be considered for inclusion in robust monitoring programs for threatened species and threatened ecosystems. These factors can be grouped under four broad themes \textendash{} the design of monitoring programs, the structure and governance of monitoring programs, data management and reporting, and appropriate funding and legislative support. We briefly discuss key attributes of our checklist under these themes. Key topics in our first theme of the design of monitoring programs include appropriate objective setting, identification of the most appropriate entities to be measured, consistency in methodology and protocols through time, ensuring monitoring is long-term, and embedding monitoring into management. Under our second theme which focuses on the structure and governance of monitoring programs for threatened species and ecosystems, we touch on the importance of adopting monitoring programs that: test the effectiveness of management interventions, produce results that are relevant to management, and engage with (and are accepted by) the community. Under Theme 3, we discuss why data management is critical and highlight that the costs of data curation, analysis and reporting need to be factored into budgets for monitoring programs. This requires that appropriate levels of funding are made available for monitoring programs, beyond just the cost of data collection \textendash{} a key topic examined in Theme 4. We provide examples, often from Australia, to highlight the importance of each of the four themes. We recognize that these themes and topics in our checklist are often closely inter-related and therefore provide a conceptual model highlighting these linkages. We suggest that our checklist can help identify the parts of existing monitoring programs for threatened species and threatened ecosystems that are adequate for the purpose or may be deficient and need to be improved.},

Technological progress regarding video cameras, sensors (such as sounders), battery life and information storage make these techniques now accessible to a majority of users. However, diver-based underwater visual censuses, and catch and effort data, remain the most commonly used for observing coastal biodiversity and species. In this paper, we review the underwater video techniques that have been developed since the 1950s to investigate and/or monitor coastal biodiversity. Techniques such as remote underwater video, whether baited or not, diver-operated video and towed video are described, along with corresponding applications in the field. We then analyse the complementary of techniques, first from studies comparing video techniques with other observation techniques, whether video-based or not, and second by documenting their respective cost efficiencies. These findings are discussed with respect to current challenges in monitoring and investigating coastal biodiversity. Video should be more often considered and used, either in addition to or as an alternative to diver-based, fishing and acoustic techniques, as it may be particularly suited for monitoring coastal biodiversity in a variety of areas and on larger scales than hitherto and within an ecosystem-based approach to management and conservation.},

Exotic species have been introduced by authorized and unauthorized stocking, bait buckets, use of ornamental plants, and through the Champlain and Chambly canals that link the lake to the Hudson River, Mohawk River, Erie Canal, and the Great Lakes. Several species, such as water chestnut and zebra mussels, have had severe ecological, economic, and nuisance effects. The rate of appearance of new species increased in the 1990s, potentially as a result of increasing activity in the basin, improved water quality in the Champlain Canal, and increased sampling. Efforts to slow the introduction of new species have focused on public education and legislation to reduce bait bucket introductions and quarantine undesirable plants; however, the major remaining vector for introductions is the Champlain Canal. An estimated 20 species have entered the lake via canals, of which at least 12 used the Champlain Canal, and numerous species in the connected drainage systems could still enter via this route; some are already in the Erie Canal. Most recently (2008), the Asian clam was discovered two locks below Lake Champlain. The Lake Champlain canals also function as a conduit for exotic species exchange between the Hudson River, St. Lawrence River, and Great Lakes. The potential for future introductions could be reduced by a biological barrier on the Champlain Canal, and additional emphasis on public education.},

Aquatic organisms are generally assumed to pass through canals actively, by passive movement, or mediated by boats; here, we demonstrate that population range extension within canals is also a dispersal mode. Our study was focused on the northern section of the Champlain Canal, which links Lake Champlain (Vermont-New York-Quebec) to the Hudson River. We sampled three dewatered locks in 2008, 2010, and 2011, and the canal channel in 2010 and 2011 using gillnets, minnow traps, electroshocking, hand nets, ichthyoplankton nets, benthic dredge, petit ponar, and hand picking; collections focused on fishes, plants, and molluscs. Secchi disk, dissolved oxygen, and temperature data were collected at the surface and bottom of the canal throughout the sampling period. We collected 43 fish species, one fish hybrid, 29 molluscs, 26 plants, three crayfish species, mudpuppy, and one species of freshwater sponge. Almost half of these species are exotic to one or both of the connected drainages. Among the fishes, evidence of reproduction within the canal was found for over half of the species. Thus, the Champlain Canal is not simply a route for invasions, but is a semi-natural ecosystem with a rich community of self-sustaining species. Canal construction or retro-fitting with barriers that ecologically separate the connected waterways could significantly reduce the threat of aquatic invasions.},

With LR one can infer if a species' habitat use is related to environmental factors and estimate the probability of species occurrence based on the values of these factors. However, studies often use inadequate sampling with regards to the arbitrarily chosen ratio between occupied and unoccupied (or available) locations, and this has a profound effect on the inference and predictive power of LR models. To demonstrate the effect of various sampling strategies/efforts on the quality of LR models, we used a unique census dataset containing all the used roosting cavities of the tree-dwelling bat Nyctalus leisleri and all cavities where the species was absent. We compared models constructed from randomly selected data subsets with varying ratios of occupied and unoccupied cavities (1:1, 1:5, 1:10) with a full dataset model (ratio 1:31). These comparisons revealed that the power of LR models was low when the sampling did not reflect the population ratio of occupied and unoccupied cavities. The use of weights improved the subsampled models. Thus, this study warns against inadequate data sampling and highly encourages a randomized sampling procedure to estimate the true ratio of occupied:unoccupied locations, which can then be used to optimize a manageable sampling effort and apply weights to improve the LR model. Such an approach may provide robust and reliable models suitable for both inference and prediction.},

  abstract = {Estimating temporal trends in spatially structured populations has a critical role to play in understanding regional changes in biological populations and developing management strategies. Designing effective monitoring programmes to estimate these trends requires important decisions to be made about how to allocate sampling effort among spatial replicates (i.e. number of sites) and temporal replicates (i.e. how often to survey) to minimise uncertainty in trend estimates. In particular, the optimal mix of spatial and temporal replicates is likely to depend upon the spatial and temporal correlations in population dynamics. Although there has been considerable interest in the ecological literature on understanding spatial and temporal correlations in species' population dynamics, little attention has been paid to its consequences for monitoring design. We address this issue using model-based survey design to identify the optimal allocation of sampling effort among spatial and temporal replicates for estimating population trends under different levels of spatial and temporal correlation. Based on linear trends, we show that how we should allocate sampling effort among spatial and temporal replicates depends crucially on the spatial and temporal correlations in population dynamics, environmental variation, observation error and the spatial variation in temporal trends. When spatial correlation is low and temporal correlation is high, the best option is likely to be to sample many sites infrequently, particularly when observation error and/or spatial variation in temporal trends are high. When spatial correlation is high and temporal correlation is low, the best option is likely to be to sample few sites frequently, particularly when observation error and/or spatial variation in temporal trends are low. When abundances are spatially independent, it is always preferable to maximise spatial replication. This provides important insights into how spatio-temporal monitoring programmes should be designed to estimate temporal trends in spatially structured populations.},

In recent years, the probability of detecting defined population trends has been the most common method of assessing monitoring programs. Such analyses require many assumptions, including a model for population change and a model for variance. To demonstrate potential effects of these assumptions on power analysis results, we present data for Red-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda) from Tern Island, Hawaii. Depending on our assumptions, the power to detect a 50\% decline over 10 years varied from 80\% to 100\%. We argue that monitoring standards based upon the ability to detect population trends should be applied cautiously. As a complementary approach, we propose that monitoring standards should emphasize attributes of sampling design that increase precision (e.g., randomization, bias, and detection probability). By using standards of precision, managers can focus on the sources of variation that can be minimized. A sampling design approach to monitoring standards provides a useful complement to standards of statistical power to detect annual trends.},

Large predators and herbivores often play keystone roles in their native ranges, and some have established invasive populations in new biogeographic regions. However, few empirical examples are available to guide expectations about how mega-fauna affect ecosystems in novel environmental and evolutionary contexts. We examined the impacts on aquatic ecosystems of an emerging population of hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibus) that has been growing in Colombia over the last 25 yr. Hippos in Africa fertilize lakes and rivers by grazing on land and excreting wastes in the water. Stable isotopes indicate that terrestrial sources contribute more carbon in Colombian lakes containing hippo populations, and daily dissolved oxygen cycles suggest that their presence stimulates ecosystem metabolism. Phytoplankton communities were more dominated by cyanobacteria in lakes with hippos, and bacteria, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrate communities were similar regardless of hippo presence. Our results suggest that hippos recapitulate their role as ecosystem engineers in Colombia, importing terrestrial organic matter and nutrients with detectable impacts on ecosystem metabolism and community structure in the early stages of invasion. Ongoing range expansion may pose a threat to water resources.},

  abstract = {Assessing the statistical power to detect changes in wildlife populations is a crucial yet often overlooked step when designing and evaluating monitoring programs. Here, we developed a simulation framework to perform spatially explicit statistical power analysis of biological monitoring programs for detecting temporal trends in occupancy for multiple species. Using raster layers representing the spatial variation in current occupancy and species-level detectability for one or multiple observation methods, our framework simulates changes in occupancy over space and time, with the capacity to explicitly model stochastic disturbances at monitoring sites (i.e., dynamic landscapes). Once users specify the number and location of sites, the frequency and duration of surveys, and the type of detection method(s) for each species, our framework estimates power to detect occupancy trends, both across the landscape and/or within nested management units. As a case study, we evaluated the power of a long-term monitoring program to detect trends in occupancy for 136 species (83 birds, 33 reptiles, and 20 mammals) across and within Kakadu, Litchfield, and Nitmiluk National Parks in northern Australia. We assumed continuation of an original monitoring design implemented since 1996, with the addition of camera trapping. As expected, power to detect trends was sensitive to the direction and magnitude of the change in occupancy, detectability, initial occupancy levels, and the rarity of species. Our simulations suggest that monitoring has at least an 80\% chance at detecting a 50\% decline in occupancy for 22\% of the modeled species across the three parks over the next 15 yr. Monitoring is more likely to detect increasing occupancy trends, with at least an 80\% chance at detecting a 50\% increase in 87\% of species. The addition of camera-trapping increased average power to detect a 50\% decline in mammals compared with using only live trapping by 63\%. We provide a flexible tool that can help decision-makers design and evaluate monitoring programs for hundreds of species at a time in a range of ecological settings, while explicitly considering the distribution of species and alternative sampling methods.},

Lakes represent excellent model case studies in this respect and have been used widely to demonstrate theories of ecological stability and resilience that are needed to underpin preventative management approaches. However, we argue that this approach is not yet fully developed because the pursuit of empirical evidence to underpin such theoretically grounded management continues in the absence of an objective probability framework. This has blurred the lines between intuitive logic (based on the elementary principles of probability) and extensional logic (based on assumption and belief) in this field. Lake ecosystems have provided much of the empirical evidence for ecological resilience theory. Here, a more rigorous logical approach is called for when translating this research into management decisions.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear responses to changing external pressures are increasingly studied in real-world ecosystems. However, as many of the changes observed by ecologists extend beyond the monitoring record, the occurrence of critical transitions, where the system is pushed from one equilibrium state to another, remains difficult to detect. Paleo-ecological records thus represent a unique opportunity to expand our temporal perspective to consider regime shifts and critical transitions, and whether such events are the exception rather than the rule. Yet, sediment core records can be affected by their own biases, such as sediment mixing or compression, with unknown consequences for the statistics commonly used to assess regime shifts, resilience, or critical transitions. To address this shortcoming, we developed a protocol to simulate paleolimnological records undergoing regime shifts or critical transitions to alternate states and tested, using both simulated and real core records, how mixing and compression affected our ability to detect past abrupt shifts. The smoothing that is built into paleolimnological data sets apparently interfered with the signal of rolling window indicators, especially autocorrelation. We thus turned to time-varying autoregressions (online dynamic linear models, DLMs; and time-varying autoregressive state-space models, TVARSS) to evaluate the possibility of detecting regime shifts and critical transitions in simulated and real core records. For the real cores, we examined both varved (annually laminated sediments) and nonvarved cores, as the former have limited mixing issues. Our results show that state-space models can be used to detect regime shifts and critical transitions in some paleolimnological data, especially when the signal-to-noise ratio is strong. However, if the records are noisy, the online DLM and TVARSS have limitations for detecting critical transitions in sediment records.},

            Estimating year-class strength\textemdash{}the number of larvae hatched in a given year\textemdash{}from survey data is key to investigating fish population dynamics. Year-class strength can be estimated from catch-at-age data using catch curves. In practice, most catch-curve assumptions are violated, which can result in spurious estimates of year-class strength. Among the simplifying assumptions is that pooling individuals into annual age-classes provides a representation of the population age structure that is adequate for estimating mortality. This oversimplification is unnecessary when age data are available at finer scales, and can lead to biased results. We present a new method to estimate past year-class strength with a set of equations that apply to each sampled individual. Through the reconstruction of individual histories from hatch to capture, this approach takes full advantage of the individual resolution of survey data, enables the incorporation of the processes that violate catch-curve assumptions, and provides more accurate year-class strength estimates.},

Species' population trends are fundamental to conservation, underpinning IUCN red-list classifications, many national lists of threatened species and are used globally to convey to policy makers the state of nature. Clearly, it's crucial to quantify how much we can trust population trend data, yet many studies analysing large numbers of population time series lack a straightforward way to do so. 2. Here we present a novel method that artificially degrades high quality population trend data to see how often subsets of the data, taken according to different sampling methods, correctly estimate the direction and magnitude of each population's complete trend. We test our method on a dataset of 27,930 waterbird population time series from across North America. 3. We find that if a significant trend is detected, even from only a small subset of years, it is likely to be representative of the complete trend. But you need to sample for many years to be confident that an insignificant trend (indicating a stable population) is correct, and it is more likely to be missing a decline than an increase in a population. 4. Our methods provide a clear and quantitative way to assign confidence to species trends, which will enable rigour to be added to large-scale population analyses, and can facilitate planning of future monitoring schemes. Our methods are readily applicable to other taxa and we provide the tools to do so.},

Obtaining those sample sizes can be more feasible when volunteers contribute to the dataset, but volunteer-selected sites are not always representative of a population. Previous work to account for biased site selection has relied on knowledge of covariates to explain differences between site types, but such knowledge is often unavailable. For cases where relevant covariates have not been defined, we used a simulation study to identify the consequences of including non-probabilistically selected sites (NP sites) in addition to sites selected from a probability-based design (P sites), test modeling frameworks that might correct for biases, and evaluate whether those frameworks could allow NP sites to reduce the sampling requirement for P sites and potentially reduce costs of monitoring. We informed the simulation with pilot data from surveys of monarch butterflies and their obligate larval host plant, milkweed. We found strong biases in NP sites versus P sites in density and trends of monarchs and milkweed. Modeling frameworks that accounted for site type with a group effect or that strongly downweighted NP sites successfully produced unbiased estimates. However, sampling more NP sites typically did not improve accuracy or precision, and adding NP sites sometimes required also adding P sites to prevent biases. Further work on novel modeling frameworks would be useful to allow citizenscience data to contribute useful information to conservation.},

However, monitoring programs not always designed to consider statistical power, site selection, or the full costs and benefits of monitoring. Further, data from monitoring programs with different goals and protocols are now being combined for comparative analyses. Key considerations can be incorporated into the optimal design of a management program with simulations and experiments. Here, we advocate for the expanded use of a third approach: non-random sampling of previously-collected data. This approach conducts experiments with available data to understand the consequences of different monitoring approaches. We first illustrate non-random sampling in the context of monitoring programs to assess species trends. We then apply the approach to a pair of additional, more general case studies to show the versatility of conducting experiments with previously-collected data. Non-random sampling of previously-collected data is underutilized, but has the potential to improve monitoring programs. We show that this approach is useful in monitoring species trends, understanding fisheries and agriculture, as well as other areas. When combined with data on the cost of monitoring, this approach can also be used to assess the value of information gained from monitoring.},

The development of paleoecology from an emerging field investigating past environments to a highly relevant applied science is reviewed and general examples of the application of paleoecologic research to resource management questions in diverse habitats and regions are provided. Specific examples of the application of paleoecologic research to the restoration of the Greater Everglades Ecosystem of south Florida (U.S.A) are presented. Conducting valuable scientific research that would benefit resource management decisions, however, is not enough. Scientists and resource managers need to be engaged in collaborative discussions from the beginning of the research process in order to ensure that management questions are being addressed and that the science reaches the people who will benefit from the information. Paleoecology and related disciplines provide an understanding of how ecosystems and individual species function and change over time in response to both natural and anthropogenic drivers. Information on pre-anthropogenic baseline conditions is provided by paleoecologic research, but it is the detection of long-term trends and cycles that allow resource managers to set realistic goals and targets by moving away from the fixed-point baseline concept to one of dynamic landscapes that anticipates and incorporates an expectation of change into decision-making.},
