# Things to do:

- writing intro
- writing methods/results pair of section
- writing dicussion
- setting up bibliography system
- Possible journals: Methods Ecology and Evolution, Biological Conservation, *Journal of Environmental Management*, *Environmental Monitoring and Assessment*, BioScience 

# Main messages of manuscript

- We can choose the number of samples and effort we use...
- Number of samples required depends on question asked and the time series parameters
- Case study of paleo data shows the utility of iterative sampling in detecting change points

# Introduction and setup

- Set up ideas about monitoring and cost of monitoring

Environmental monitoring is one of the core components to modern research and management (citations). However, many monitoring programs are expensive and time-consuming (citations). Therefore, an optimal...

- Idea of detecting change over time

One of the primary goals of monitoring programs is to detect long-term ecological change. 

- Historical data and ability to choose how much to sample

Because of new technological advances, there are many data sources that can be derived long after the actual  processes occured. For example, paleoecological lake cores can be extracted and ecological communities can be built from this... Similarly, samples for eDNA or videographical approaches can record time points of a system and be analyzed later (citations). In each of these cases, decisions have to made about how much data to extract from the previously collected samples. Should the paleo core be analyzed at every centimeter? Should the video be assessed at every minute? As long as analyzing samples is expensive, these tradeoffs will remain.

- Here, we develop a set of tools to determine the appropriate number of samples and sampling approach when dealing with data sources where additional samples can be added. We first investigate these tools using a simulated-based apporach. We then apply these tools to the detection of change points for a set of lakes...

# Which sampling strategies are available?

- Random
- Regular
- Iterative
