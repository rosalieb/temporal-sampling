__Study highlights__:
- Environmental monitoring is important, but expensive.  
- The expense of sample analysis may limit which samples can be processed.  
- We use simulation methods and empirical tools to identify shifts in time series indicators.  
- We apply these methods to Cladocera community indicators derived from sediment cores.  
- We show these methods are applicable to a wide array of questions and system
